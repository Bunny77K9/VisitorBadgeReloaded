# Visitor Badge Reloaded

![](https://visitor-badge-reloaded.herokuapp.com/badge?page_id=visitor-badge-reloaded-visitors&color=232323&style=for-the-badge&logo=Github)

**Visitor Badge Reloaded** is a recreation of the the popular [visitor-badge](https://github.com/jwenjian/visitor-badge) which is __no longer maintained__, unfortunately. In addition, it was missing some features which made it feel incomplete to me. It was also written using Python which I'm personally not a huge fan of; especially the performance.

*There is a similar project made by ESKYoung who forked the project and implemented other features before to customize the badge found [here](https://github.com/ESKYoung/shields-io-visitor-counter)*

## Features
- **direct replacement** (refer to `Migrating From Visitor Badge`)
- customizable badge: colour, style, text, logo

## Defaults
- Colour: "blue"
- Style: "square"
- Text: "Visitors"
- Logo: *no logo*

## Migrating From Visitor Badge
*Since **Visitor Badge Reloaded** was made to have all the same features as the original Visitor Badge with extra, even the format of the badges are exact same. This means that all you have to do is replace the __url__ of the badge with `https://visitor-badge-reloaded.herokuapp.com/badge?page_id=<your own page_id here>`. The total visits will remain the **exact same** as well.*
